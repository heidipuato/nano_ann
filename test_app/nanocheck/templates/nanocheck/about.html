                  <p class="card-text" id="info"> The concept of QSAR modeling is that physiological activity of particles can be inferred 
                    from their associated chemical compositions. In this context, toxic effects of
                    nanoparticles can be modelled as a function of molecular descriptors that a nanoparticles
                    has. Molecular descriptors are the physicochemical properties of a molecule, this include
                    their molar volume, electronegativity, polarizability, size, spectral moments, etc..

                  <p class="card-text" id="info"> Perturbation theory is a method used to improve an approximation by calculating errors
                    or deviations from an initial solution.

                  <p class="card-text" id="info"> QSAR-Perturbation model or PT-QSAR model is the resulting technique of integrating
                    the perturbation theory in classic QSAR modeling. Using this model, the limitation
                    of classic QSAR was addressed. By generating NP-NP pairs, the classification of the
                    NPs are extended to consider the different experimental conditions it is under and the
                    several bio-target they are tested against.

                  </div>
                  <p class="card-text" id="info"> Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a deep learning algorithm, 
                    which is a subset of machine learning. ANN is a computational model that tries to mimic how the human brain works,
                    hence human intervention are minimized. 
                    ANN is composed of three node layers that are interconnected with each other.
                    The input layer, which consist the input neurons, accepts the data and directly pass it onto the hidden layer. 
                    The hidden layer are the inner layers that is responsible for receiving the data and will perform the 
                    information gathering by weighing it according to the ANN's internal system. 
                    Lastly, the output layer is where the desired predictions are obtained.
                    By going through these layers, predictions are made as the weighted sum of the neurons in the neural network.
